Simple!

"The question number": {
    "option name": is it correct? (true or false)
    repeat as many times as you want

    WARNING: Program will probably not check if there is a correct option

}

Example:
[
    {
        "question": "Correct?",
        "randomize": false, //optional, default true
        options: {
            "incorrect 1": false,
            "incorrect 2": false,
            "incorrect 3": false,
            "correct": true
        }
    }
]
