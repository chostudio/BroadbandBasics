Created for the HACC 2022.

## How to run
### Prerequisites
1. Have npm and Node.js installed. 
2. Run the following commands <br>
```
npm install 
node index.js
```
`npm install` does not need to be ran every time. It is used to install all the necessary dependencies to run this project. Ideally you should be running this command every time you run the project after you pull from another branch. <br>
`node index.js` actually serves the app.
3. Go to http://localhost:8080/ in the browser :)
